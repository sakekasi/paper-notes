title: Hesam Samimi, Rebecca Hicks, Ari Fogel, Todd Millstein - Declarative Mocking
type: text/x-markdown

## [PAPER](https://www.mendeley.com/viewer/?fileId=20ea389f-5257-c477-3cfe-855840fc9434&documentId=e4cedd81-5533-354a-b643-e820add9a0b9)

* developers write method specifications in a high level logical language fore the API being mocked, and a constraint solver dynamically executes these specifications when the methods are invoked.
* allows data and aspects of the environment to be easily mocked
  - specify predicates using `assume` followed by a predicate
* allows for nondeterminism in testing
  - `unique` allows the guarantee of different test cases that all fulfill the specified constraints
* with specifications, the programmer can naturally start with a bare-bones mock whose specifications are very weak and then incrementally strengthen the specifications based on the requirements of the client code under test
* specifications are just as error prone as mocks, and can be hard to debug
  - a fix for this issue may be to do an example generation type thing and show examples that match the constraints
